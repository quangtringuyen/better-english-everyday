Conversation 
Gulam:&nbsp;&nbsp;Steven! Good to see you brother! How are you? How was your trip?
Steven:&nbsp;&nbsp;It was fine. I've been better but, it's great to be home, I've missed you all! How's mom?
Gulam:&nbsp;&nbsp;She's great! All she ever does is talk about you -her little boy that went to the United States. You're her pride and joy, you know that?
Steven:&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't wait to see her. And you? What's new with you?
Gulam:&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Nisha and I are expecting! You'll have another nephew or niece soon!
Steven:&nbsp;&nbsp;That's great! Wow! Congrats! You two are great together, ya know. You have such a beautiful family. I hope one day I can have that.
Gulam:&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, man! Come on! I mean, everything was set here for you to marry Shalini! You know, she's still pining after you. I don't think she'll ever get over you.
Steven:&nbsp;&nbsp;What are you talking about? I hardly knew her! How could she be in love with me? I couldn't go through with it even though she is a great woman. No, I left my heart in the United States. I just hope Veronica is happy.
Gulam:&nbsp;&nbsp;Get over it! You're home now. Everyone here thinks so highly of you; there'll be girls throwing themselves at you. You can marry anyone you want!
Steven:&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want to marry anyone! I want to marry her! Don't you understand?
Gulam:&nbsp;&nbsp;You are incorrigible.
Liliana:&nbsp;&nbsp;Steven! My baby how are you! I've missed you so much!
Steven:&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, mom! Great to see you!
Liliana:&nbsp;&nbsp;You look so thin! Didn't those Americans feed you? Come come, let's have some chai. By the way... There is a girl here waiting for you.
Veronica:&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi Steven.
Steven:&nbsp;&nbsp;Veronica! How did you get here? How did you know where I live? I waited for you at the airport but you never showed...
Veronica:&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have some little secrets that I haven't told you about, but we can discuss that later. I realized that I was just scared. Scared of how much I love you and of the commitment that marriage requires. I'm here now. Now there is something I wanna ask you. Steven, will you marry me?
Priest:&nbsp;&nbsp;I now declare you, husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.
