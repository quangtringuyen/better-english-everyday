Conversation 
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I don't know if you heard, but someone moved into that old house down the road.
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I know. I met the owner of the house yesterday as he was moving in. His name is Armand.
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;Really? What's he like? You have to fill me in.
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, he's a bit strange. I don't know... I've got a bad feeling about him.
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;Really? Why?
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yesterday I brought over a housewarming gift, but Armand started acting really weird, and then he practically kicked me out! I tried to, sort of, peek into his house, but everything was so dark inside that I couldn't really get a good look. 
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you'll never guess what I saw this morning. A delivery truck pulled into his driveway, and it dropped off a long, rectangular box. It almost looked like a coffin!
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;You see! Why would he...
C:&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello ladies...
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, Armand! You scared the heck out of me! This is my friend Doris.
C:&nbsp;&nbsp;A pleasure to meet you...If you are not doing anything tonight, I would like to have you both for dinner. I mean...I would like to have you both over for dinner.
