Conversation 
Mr. Smith:&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m glad you could find time to meet with me, Mr. Johnson. I can’t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today, the ambiance here is lovely! 
Mr. Johnson:&nbsp;&nbsp;No problem, if possible I always combine business with pleasure. Now, let’s hear more about these chocolates you’re offering. 
Mr. Smith:&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, as you know, I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States. They’re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market. Naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately. I think your brand exemplifies many ofthe same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious, first class dining. 
Mr. Johnson:&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmmm, sounds interesting…. gourmet chocolates , where are they produced? Belgium? 
Mr. Smith:&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, the factory is located in Scotland. 
Mr. Johnson:&nbsp;&nbsp;Really? I didn’t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production… 
Mr. Smith:&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units. They’ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well. Here, I brought these especially for you, try one! 
Mr. Johnson:&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, thanks. Mmm, hmm, creamy texture, smooth…. 
Mr. Smith:&nbsp;&nbsp;Unique aren’t they? I bet you’ve never tasted anything like it! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one’s cutting corners with the ingredients. Only the crème de la crème make it through inspection. 
Mr. Johnson:&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, very interesting flavors……. Slightly spicy, very unique, that’s for sure. Exactly what ARE the ingredients? 
Mr. Smith:&nbsp;&nbsp;I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down inthe Granger family for generations. I’m sure you can keep a secret. Buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar and Haggis. 
Mr. Johnson:&nbsp;&nbsp;Haggis? What’s Haggis? 
Mr. Smith:&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a traditional Scottish delicacy; you take sheep’s liver, heart and lung and stuff it inside ofthe sheep’s stomach. 
Mr. Johnson:&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, get back to you. 
Mr. Smith:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Johnson? Mr. Johnson?
