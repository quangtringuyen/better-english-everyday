Conversation 
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to Perfect Getaway Tours . How can I help you? 
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife. 
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;Very well, we have a couple of different options such as beaches, the wilderness, the countryside or even going to a spa for the weekend. 
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;I think something in the countryside would be nice. 
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfect! This package includes round-trip flights to New Hampshire . A free airport pick- up is included. Our VIP limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger foods to soften the thirty-minute ride to the countryside. 
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds good! What is the hotel that we will be staying at like? 
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the best part. Your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to accommodate a maximum of that is guests. You will enjoy an intimate and private time in this very spacious and warm N Included in the price is three meals a day, excluding beverages. You can choose to eat at the fabulous restaurant that offers a stunning view of the lush, green gardens. If you prefer, your own private butler can arrange your meal to be served in your room or outside on our terrace. 
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow! This sounds like something my wife would really enjoy! Are there any outdoor activities we can take part in ? 
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course! The hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail. You can also go fishing to the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard. 
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sold ! I want to book this trip. I don't care what it costs! Money is no object !
