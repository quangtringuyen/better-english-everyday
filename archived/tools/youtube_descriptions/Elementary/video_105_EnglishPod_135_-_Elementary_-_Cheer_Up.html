A:&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok... I'll talk to you later. Bye
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;Carrie, are you ok? You seem a bit down.
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;I just got off the phone with my boyfriend. He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing. It's so hard to talk to him at times.
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it's just that he is stressed out from work or something. He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know.
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah but, he is always in a really foul mood. I try to find out what's bothering him or get him to talk about his day but, he always shuts down and brushes me off.
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;Men are like that you know. They can feel nervous, anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness.
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess you are right. What do you think I should do? He wasn't always this grouchy you know...
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk to him, try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn't work, I say get rid of him and get a new one!
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;You are something else you know that?
