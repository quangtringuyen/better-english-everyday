Conversation 
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;Honey, do you have a second?
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure! Are you okay? You seem a bit worried. What's on your mind?
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to talk.
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay...
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been thinking, and well, I think we need to start seeing other people.
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;What? Why? I mean, we've had our ups and downs, and we have the occasional disagreement, but we're happy together, aren't we?
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;That's just it, I'm not happy anymore, Tim. It's not you, it's me. I know that I can be hard to deal with, and you are a great guy! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for!
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what are you saying? You're breaking up with me because I'm perfect?
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;Tim, you are too good for me. You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy. Oh, I could say that I'll be all you need, but that would be a lie. I know I'd only hurt you, I know I'd only make you cry.
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;Baby, come on. Don't do this to me! Whatever it is, we can work it out. Just give me another chance! I know that we can get through this, but we gotta stick together! Don't leave me.
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't, Tim. I hope someday you can find some way to understand I'm only doing this for you. I don't really wanna go but, deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do.
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;Laura...
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are your keys. I'll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week. I'm sorry, Tim. I wish you all the best, and I hope that one day we can meet again. I'll always love you. Goodbye.
