Conversation 
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you're applying for a B2 visa, where is your final destination and what's the purpose of your trip to the United States?
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm going to visit my brother; he's just had a baby. He lives in Minneapolis.
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;And how long do you you plan to remain in the United States?
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll be here for approximately three weeks. See, here's my return ticket for the twenty-sixth of March.
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;And, who is sponsoring your trip?
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;My brother, here, this is an invitation letter from him. I will stay with him and his family in their home.
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;Alright, tell me about the ties you have to your home country.
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I own a house; actually, I'm leaving my dog there with my neighbors. I have a car at home, and oh, my job! I'm employed by Tornel as an engineer. Actually, I only have three weeks' vacation, so I have to go back to work at the end of March.
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent?
B:&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I do have assets in my country; like I said, I own a house, and see, here's a bank statement showing my investments, and my bank balance.
A:&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sorry, sir, we cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time, instead, you are granted a resident visa! Congratulations, you are the millionth person to apply for a visa! You win! Congratulations!
