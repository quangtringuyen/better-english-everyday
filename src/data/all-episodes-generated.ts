As I'm sure you're all aware, with the credit crunch, and the global financial crisis, we're obligated to look for more cost efficient ways of producing our goods.

Your sister's husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings. what's their name again? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise- themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine. And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we'll make our toasts! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors? Who else am I missing?

The ovaries. are packed with eggs and each month during the middle of the menstrual cycle, the ripest one will be sucked up by one of the fallopian tubes. This is called ovulation and the exact time of ovulation depends on the length of your cycle. In an average 28 day cycle, ovulation will most likely happen between the 12th and 15th days, counting day 1 as the first day of your last period." },

Now this is where the race begins and all those millions of sperm will race and swim from the cervix, through the uterus to the fallopian tubes. This could take anywhere from forty five minutes to twelve hours! Not all of them make it, since some go the wrong way and get lost or simply die. Many will actually reach the egg but only one will penetrate it and fertilize it. Once this happens, the egg instantly changes and creates a protective shield once the sperm is safely inside." },

      { speaker: "A", text: "Well, the egg will be fertilized within about 24 hours of its release. The genetic material from the sperm combines with the genetic material in the egg to create a new cell that will rapidly start dividing. The woman is not actually pregnant until that bundle of new cells, known as the embryo, travels the rest of the way down the fallopian tube and attaches itself to the wall of her uterus.

As I'm sure you're all aware, with the credit crunch, and the global financial crisis, we're obligated to look for more cost efficient ways of producing our goods. We don't want to have to be looking at redundancies. So, we've outlined a brief plan to implement the just-in-time philosophy." },

      { speaker: "B", text: "Well, we want to reduce production and delivery lead timesfor better overall efficiency." },
      { speaker: "A", text: "Right, production lead times can be reduced by moving work stations closer together, reducing queue length, like for example, reducing the number of jobs waiting to be processed at a given machine, and improving the coordination and cooperation between successive processes. Delivery lead times can be reduced through close cooperation with suppliers, possibly by inducing suppliers to locate closer to the factory or working with a faster shipping company." },
      { speaker: "C", text: "I see… That makes sense." },
      { speaker: "B", text: "The second point is that we want to require supplier quality assurance and implement a zero defects quality program. We currently have far too many errors that lead to defective items and therefore, they must be eliminated. A quality control at the source program must be implemented to give workers the personal responsibility for the quality of the work they do, and the authority to stop production when something goes wrong." },

Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting." },
      { speaker: "B", text: "I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable." },

Mufasa dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliché." },
      { speaker: "A", text: "How can it be cliché? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love." },
